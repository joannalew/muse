# README

# Coding Challenge from The Muse

Build a web app that allows users to learn information about a job and 
links them to be able to apply when they’re interested.

Ensure you that it contains at least the following fields:
Company name
Company logo
Location
Job title
Job description
Link to apply

You may also include other information, 3rd party embeds 
(i.e. Twitter feed, Facebook timeline, YouTube video), etc. 
you think would be useful and relevant to the user. 
Feel free to experiment and show off

Set up database structure to power it
Create APIs to pull data from the database
Web frontend should call the appropriate APIs 
    to get the proper data for a given job 
    and display it to a user

There is no specific design to develop towards - 
just create something you find clean and attractive that 
you would like to use. 

Feel free to take inspiration from design elements within the Muse 
or, if you prefer, to show off if this is an area in which you shine

You’re welcome to use whatever technologies with which you feel 
most comfortable showing off your best work. 
If you’re curious what we work most with, 
our standard stack is Python/Django, React, and Postgres

Add a README explaining how to run the project. 
Send the project to me 12 hours or more before the scheduled interview time.

The expectation is that this will take about 8 hours of work to complete. 
Attached are some sample job descriptions to use.

Be prepared to demo your project for us, 
both walking through the use of it as well as walking through the code
